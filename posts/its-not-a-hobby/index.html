        <p>Past couple of days I’ve been listening to <em>In Rainbows</em> by Radiohead over and over again. Put aside my sick love for Radiohead, listening to this made me think about some things. Let’s break them down.</p>
<p>This is for everyone that likes to claim they’re educated, well put together, progressive, intelligent, “better than everyone else.” For you, “renaissance” people who think they’ve left behind ordinary people:</p>
<p><strong>You’re boring.</strong></p>
<p>You’re as boring as a bowl of plain oatmeal, except you don’t even help control cholesterol, and you’re not rich in fiber. You know what? You’re not oatmeal. That’s insulting to oatmeal. You’re just boring. You celebrate getting a degree like it isn’t just a fucking endurance contest, but when I ask you about your favorite albums, movies, or paintings, or, God forbid, a nice poem, you freeze up like a 2007 PC when it tries to run <em>Crysis</em> on low settings. <strong>You’re pathetic.</strong></p>
<p>I’m losing patience for people who tell me their hobbies are <em>“listening to music”</em> and <em>“watching movies.”</em></p>
<p>It’s not a hobby, you fucking cunt. It’s your duty as a human being to consume as much art as you can, growing and nurturing your spiritual being, and carving your taste. I like money—it’s a nice thing—but it’s so sad to watch you spend your money on bullshit that’s worthless, while you’re living in a time where art is so accessible, yet none of you “intellectuals” actually have anything resembling a developed taste.</p>
<p>You know what’s the saddest part? You’re actively consuming the biggest bullshit out there, getting your fill of “art” from TikTok… And if you can’t understand why that’s sad, you’re not only not an intellectual—you’re a textbook example of a moron.</p>
<p>Now, it’s not all bad. I know some amazing, inspiring people who are actually trying to learn more about the world, finding ways to improve it. They’re some of the busiest people I know, all over the world. And yet, somehow, they make time for art. They all consume incredible pieces of art and have exquisite taste, sometimes not even resembling mine. <strong>It’s beautiful to see.</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, if you feel like I’m calling you out personally, you’re the biggest piece of brainless donkey shit, and such a little egocentric, egotistical cunt. It’s so easy not to belong to the group I’m calling out.</p>
<p>For fuck’s sake, just type in your Spotify:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Kid A</em></li>
<li><em>Dark Side of the Moon</em></li>
<li><em>Abbey Road</em></li>
<li><em>The Joshua Tree</em></li>
<li><em>What’s Going On</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There—5 suggestions off the top of my head. Or… and this is a wild one, just fucking Google “Greatest albums of all time” and start skimming through the list. Some, you’ll like. Some, you won’t. But at least you’ll be exposed to something that’s actually worth your time—if you have the ability to pay attention to something that isn’t classified as a fucking reality show for 45 minutes to an hour.</p>
<p>You probably won’t be able to do it in the beginning, but believe me, it’s worth a shot. Build that muscle up. <strong>You’ll be enjoying this little blip of existence considerably more.</strong></p>
<p>To close this profanity-filled, heartfelt letter of appreciation, I will leave you with this&hellip;</p>
<p>Thom Yorke once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“You know you’re in trouble when people stop listening to sad music, because the moment that people stop listening to sad music, they don’t wanna know anymore. They’re turning themselves off.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And believe me, break-up songs are just the tip of the iceberg. Get in there. Explore your emotions. All of them. The whole thing—the whole spectrum. It may not be what you expect, but it will 100% be worth it.</p>
<p>This applies to movies, poems, books, paintings, music—anything and everything.</p>
<p>The moment we sold art in favor of money is the moment we lost the best part of humanity. <strong>I desperately want to find it again with as many people as I can.</strong></p>
<p>I am literally begging you to get on the wagon. We need it. Every day more than yesterday.</p>
<p>I may not be the gentlest with my language, but that’s because I’m a peasant with a heart of an artist.</p>
<p>I just want you with me here. I just want you to experience this, because I promise you, you will not find a better drug than this. And this one may extend your life. Who knows? If it inspires you to create something, it may make you immortal.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,<br>
<strong>Damad Butkovic</strong></p>
