        I had some weird realizations lately. I decided to relax. Just be normal. Go out with friends, go on field trips, you know, “enjoy” life. And… it REALLY didn’t work. I was never more stressed in my life. I felt miserable. This is what the days would look like in the past summer. I’d finish work, and phone home that I won’t be eating lunch at home. I’d go out with people and not like a crazy amount of people, just my regular group of people that I’d go out with even outside this “experiment”.

        I&rsquo;m a very difficult person to be around. Phew. That kinda felt good to admit. No one wants that. Everybody wants to be that easy going, approachable type. Well&hellip; I&rsquo;m not.
I lose interest in conversations extremely fast. I hate small talk. I know everyone says that, but through my &ldquo;research&rdquo;, I call bullshit. People don&rsquo;t want to talk about anything deeper than what makes them feel superior. I challenge you, just for yourself, stand in front of a mirror, and call out your insecurities.

        Usually I have at least a title. Now I don&rsquo;t. I know vaguely what I want to say, but that&rsquo;s about it. And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll make a big intro to this. I&rsquo;ll just say this.
I want to feel sad. I want to cry. I fooled myself into thinking that being happy is the final goal. FUCK. THAT. I want to feel it all. I want the experience of failure to bring me every emotion.

        A couple of days back, my friend and colleague sent me an interesting text. She was out on a company organized dinner for women in our company. She made a, kinda sarcastic remark that went something like this:
After this I don&rsquo;t know whether to feel lonely or to give birth to a child.
This kickstarted a circle of thoughts in my mind about loneliness. I&rsquo;ve written about relationships before, and just like then, I&rsquo;m not sure this will make sense completely, because some of the things are just me thinking as I go.

        Throughout my life I&rsquo;ve changed my views on things many times. It usually happens when I figure out that I&rsquo;m wrong about something. It can go back and forth, it&rsquo;s exhausting. I don&rsquo;t recommend thinking as an activity, it can get very boring. This time, I would like to tell a story of how, after many years of thinking, I may have unlocked the best place for a good state of my mind so far and I currently see no other way to improve it.

        Less than a year ago, I was a militant pro vaxxer. I couldn&rsquo;t even fathom the idea that someone doesn&rsquo;t want to get vaccinated and I had absolutely no sympathy for people that caught COVID and weren&rsquo;t vaccinated.
Do I still think we should get vaccinated? Yes, absolutely. There&rsquo;s more than solid evidence that it works and it&rsquo;s saving lives.
Where I differ from my past self is that I don&rsquo;t think mandates are a good idea.

        This is something that I have been thinking a lot lately.
How does history remember us?
Every generation has these huge events that they&rsquo;re remembered for and because of the simplifications that are common for a human mind, often we separate the participants of those events into &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo;. As history goes on, we seem to put more and more people into the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; category. A very small number of people have been remembered as universally good.

I&rsquo;ve talked about science a lot lately. What I&rsquo;m about to do in this post has no science behind it, at least not that I know of.

        I&rsquo;m a little late to the party, but yesterday I finally saw &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look up&rdquo;. Since I&rsquo;m not a movie critic, and I don&rsquo;t know much about movies, I&rsquo;m not going to go into that. However, this movie did make me ask myself one question. Before I ask it, I first need to tell you a story.
One of my closest friends, for a decade now, is also one of the smartest people I know.

        Hey there, future scientist.
So you want to be a scientist? Help the World. Improve our understanding of the universe, improve the way we live our lives, improve the quality of life, our health? Good luck! I hope you do. I was never brave enough for that. Because I was never brave enough for that, I became an engineer. A lower class. Engineering is a wonderful thing, but we are just fixing things with tools you, scientists, provide us with.
