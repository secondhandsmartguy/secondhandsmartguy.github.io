        <p>I&rsquo;m a very difficult person to be around. Phew. That kinda felt good to admit. No one wants that. Everybody wants to be that easy going, approachable type. Well&hellip; I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>I lose interest in conversations extremely fast. I hate small talk. I know everyone says that, but through my &ldquo;research&rdquo;, I call bullshit. People don&rsquo;t want to talk about anything deeper than what makes them feel superior. I challenge you, just for yourself, stand in front of a mirror, and call out your insecurities. It sucks doing it just for yourself, let alone in front of other people. Having a conversation with me, for a normal, regular person, feels like running a marathon. This isn&rsquo;t my opinion, I&rsquo;ve been told that on many occasions.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t let loose. I like to listen to music a lot, but if I judge something to be crap, I can&rsquo;t even pretend to enjoy it.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t watch random things on TV or youtube. I became so elitist that I can&rsquo;t enjoy easy comedy. It has to be political, dark, hard to understand, or else I see it as easy jokes and I don&rsquo;t laugh. Not because I don&rsquo;t want to, but I literally don&rsquo;t feel like laughing.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for people without ambition. I literally can&rsquo;t be around them. It feels like someone is stabbing a fork in my brain. I wanted to be an engineer, so I became one. I wanted to play many instruments, so I learned them. I wanted to be able to save someone&rsquo;s life, so I learned first aid on a very high level. I wanted to produce music, so I learned that. I wanted to have a studio, so I worked and built one. I wanted to talk about things that bugged my brain, so I started a podcast. I wanted to be useful in the household so I learned how to fix shit and how to cook. Then I wanted to actually admit shit and fix things about my character, so I started a blog where I publically call myself out and hold myself accountable. And there are things I do that aren&rsquo;t ready to be talked about. All in due time, but rest assured that there are more big things coming. I think this is the first time I actually spoke about all of these things. I feel proud of myself and I&rsquo;m kinda tired of hiding it. But see? This is why I can&rsquo;t stand unambitious people. Because I may have a problem with being too ambitious. Having a conversation with someone without ambition is like volunteering to step on a lego every time they start another sentence.</p>
<p>The way I said this, I think you might be wondering is this something I want to change or something that bothers me? I gotta be honest&hellip; I love it. I love being this way. I like that not everyone can be around me. Saves me a lot of time because I don&rsquo;t have to act like I care about the weather, a random gossip, or someone bragging about being good at a job literally a monkey could do.</p>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;m saying this is because I want to believe anyone can actually have a conversation with me, if only they tried to actually talk, I would learn from them and they would learn from me. Most of the time, people just want to seem smarter than me to themselves. And honestly, I stopped giving a fuck. Feel smarter. Feel superior. Fulfill the void in yourself for a day because you think you&rsquo;re smarter than me. At least I stopped fooling myself that I can pull God by his balls. I don&rsquo;t care about you. I care about being better, so that one day, in spite of being all of this, I can be approachable. Maybe not easy to be around, but I&rsquo;m gonna start with approachable.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Damad Butkovic</p>
