        <p>I had some weird realizations lately. I decided to relax. Just be normal. Go out with friends, go on field trips, you know, “enjoy” life. And… it REALLY didn’t work. I was never more stressed in my life. I felt miserable. This is what the days would look like in the past summer. I’d finish work, and phone home that I won’t be eating lunch at home. I’d go out with people and not like a crazy amount of people, just my regular group of people that I’d go out with even outside this “experiment”. There were a couple of realizations that made sense and felt good. But most of the time I felt so insanely bad and miserable. It got to the point where I took all my savings, which I would never do previously, and I just splurged on things to make myself feel a little better. But.. Why did it feel so bad? What happened?</p>
<p>What does a regular “time with friends” look like? You go out, sit in a bar, and talk. Easy enough. How can that feel bad? Easy. Spending 4 hours of your time going out, just to hear the same stories over and over again can get very depressing. This is all we talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who’s fucking who?</li>
<li>Who should be fucking who?</li>
<li>Do we know someone for someone in the group?</li>
<li>“A friend” is dating someone they shouldn’t</li>
<li>Another friend is dating someone they really should</li>
<li>How was work?</li>
</ul>
<p><code>	</code>Once we answered all these impossibly deep questions, the rest of the conversations would circle back to them in one way or another.</p>
<p><code>	</code>It got me thinking… Where are all the dreams? Where are ambitions? All the people around me are in the group of 21-26 I think. Maybe a couple exceptions. And of course, some of them are notable exceptions to my problem with this. Example is one of my friends that lights up every time he starts talking about movies. And hey, he’s writing one too. It’s beautiful to see. Another one of us has a girlfriend in another city, but still manages to work, study, intern in a company and work on a project with me.</p>
<p>I remember, a third friend drove me home one night after we all hung out. The outing was so boring that at that point I was a couple of days short of sitting in the corner of my room, curled up, crying. But he saved me from it. We spent 2 hours sitting in his car and he was talking about the different mechanisms of car breaks, and some ways to use them when doing car racing.</p>
<p>Now listen, I don’t know jack shit about movies, movie making, cars or car breaks, but I love listening to people that talk about their passions.</p>
<p>A couple weeks later I went out with a friend of mine that I haven’t seen in quite a while. She’s a biologist, future phd, and a person with a massive amount of ambition and discipline. She’s working in a museum in my town, and I know she’ll go on to do massive things. Once we were done and I went home, I felt rejuvenated because I just had a productive talk with someone.</p>
<p>There are other people that do great things, and I don’t have patience to write that much, so I’ll mention just one more example.</p>
<p>I have a friend that’s a young architect with an amazing passion for it. That same man has a passion for design, photography and music and he’s doing every single of those things while being in a relationship with a wonderful girl who also happens to be my friend.</p>
<p>And these are people I want to spend my time around.</p>
<p>Why did I mention them? Answer is, because if I’m not out with one of them, I see no passion in people beyond going to work, being in a relationship, partying and possibly having kids. I don’t wanna judge, it’s great, people should work, normal ones should be in relationships, sometimes we all like some form of a party, and the vast majority of us want kids. But where are the dreams? At what point in their life did they die? How deep are they buried? Is there a way to give birth to new dreams?</p>
<p>The part that made me feel awful was to see some of the aforementioned people try to start a conversation about something deeper or something they have a passion for, and see the very people that have no passions and no dreams interrupt them and not let them finish. God that felt so awful I wanted to take a chair and hit them over their head. If only I was paying attention to who was interrupting instead of who was speaking.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with small things in life. I like it when my friends are happy because their S.O. did something nice. I like it when they do something great at work. But none of them are doing jack shit outside of it. You know that scene when a child approaches you and they are glowing because they just made a realization that made them feel so good they had to share it? Well these people killed that in themselves because I’ll bet anything I have that when they were younger, they had something that made them feel like that.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I can do it anymore. I don’t know if I can sit with people like that. I made a joke that the next time someone invites me out “because we didn’t see each other for like 2 weeks”, I’ll just send ‘em a selfie and a guarantee on my side that it was taken right there and then. If there is nothing important you want to tell me, I don’t wanna spend my time on yet another drink where you ask me WHAT’S UP?! HOW’S WORK? ANY GIRLS AROUND? If that’s the only reason you want to see me, skip it. I realize that if someone recognizes themselves in this, they won’t invite me out anyway. Did it occur to you that was by design? *emoji with sunglasses*</p>
<p>If you want to discover your passion, or you wanna talk to someone that will actually listen to you ramble on about a thing you’re already passionate about, I’m always free for that. Sad part is, no one does that because people that don’t have these are killing it in the people that do by telling them they’re boring and should “just be normal”.</p>
<p>Fuck your normal. And fuck you. I don’t care how you live your life, but I’m about to stop giving you a chance to waste my time.</p>
<p>This is an open invitation for people to either talk to me about their passions, or for me to help you find one. It’s also an open “fuck you” to everyone that’s killing passion and dreams in other people.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Damad Butkovic</p>
