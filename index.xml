      <description>This is something that I have been thinking a lot lately.
How does history remember us?
Every generation has these huge events that they&amp;rsquo;re remembered for and because of the simplifications that are common for a human mind, often we separate the participants of those events into &amp;ldquo;good guys&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;bad guys&amp;rdquo;. As history goes on, we seem to put more and more people into the &amp;ldquo;bad guys&amp;rdquo; category. A very small number of people have been remembered as universally good.</description>

      <description>I can already see that this post is going to be very long since I don&amp;rsquo;t really have it compiled in my head completely, but I want to talk about what follows, so thank you for choosing to fly Damad Bullshit Airlines, strap in, there&amp;rsquo;s going to be some turbulence.
I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about science a lot lately. What I&amp;rsquo;m about to do in this post has no science behind it, at least not that I know of.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a little late to the party, but yesterday I finally saw &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t look up&amp;rdquo;. Since I&amp;rsquo;m not a movie critic, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about movies, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into that. However, this movie did make me ask myself one question. Before I ask it, I first need to tell you a story.
One of my closest friends, for a decade now, is also one of the smartest people I know.</description>

      <title>So you want to be a scientist?</title>

      <description>Hey there, future scientist.
So you want to be a scientist? Help the World. Improve our understanding of the universe, improve the way we live our lives, improve the quality of life, our health?Â Good luck! I hope you do. I was never brave enough for that. Because I was never brave enough for that, I became an engineer. A lower class. Engineering is a wonderful thing, but we are just fixing things with tools you, scientists, provide us with.</description>

      <description>It was the summer of 2008 when I saw a movie that would change the trajectory of my life to the path it took to bring me to who I am today. I was completely unaware of the problematic life of the main actor, obviously unaware and unprepared for the next decade or so of the movie universe that that movie will start. I mean, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even 11 yet, how could I be?</description>
