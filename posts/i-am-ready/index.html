        <p>Usually I have at least a title. Now I don&rsquo;t. I know vaguely what I want to say, but that&rsquo;s about it. And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll make a big intro to this. I&rsquo;ll just say this.</p>
<p>I want to feel sad. I want to cry. I fooled myself into thinking that being happy is the final goal. FUCK. THAT. I want to feel it all. I want the experience of failure to bring me every emotion. Anger, sadness, rock bottom, and then I want to climb out of it. Then I want to feel happy, satisfied and relieved.</p>
<p>If we think that chronic depression is horrible, why don&rsquo;t we think about chronic happiness the same.</p>
<p>I want that heartbreak to hurt. Fuck that whole notion of being happy to see your ex. I want it to feel like a truck hit me. Fuck that idea that once you&rsquo;re not friends with someone it doesn&rsquo;t suck. If it doesn&rsquo;t suck, that friendship was shit. I&rsquo;ve only been like that with 2 people, and fuck those guys. You wanna know why I want it to suck so bad? Because I want to be the person who knows that however the relationships end in my life, in the end, I know that I was willing to love that person. I can&rsquo;t say that I love instantly, I don&rsquo;t. But I want to give that benefit of the doubt to the people around me. I want to invite everyone to love them. And I want that love to be so pure, unreasoned, irrational, unexplainable.</p>
<p>One of my favorite songs is by Pearl Jam. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Just breathe&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s this beautiful lyric in it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love&rdquo;. I took it as an insult when people called me emotional before. Now I wear it as a badge of honor. I am. I&rsquo;m so profusely emotional that sometimes I&rsquo;m scared of it. It scares me so I build these walls around me. But that lyric always hits me. That&rsquo;s who I want to be. I want to be the lucky man and count on both hands the ones I love. But to achieve that, I only need 6 people. I already have 5. I have a sister, my parents and two of my friends. That&rsquo;s a lot. But I want more. Love is such a great powerful drug and I want that intoxication.</p>
<p>I think that these delusional crazy thoughts I have in my mind make me a very difficult person to be around. I understand that. My intensity is sometimes a big wall to hit. But here&rsquo;s how I see things. Every other friend that I &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&rdquo; love, I want to find ways to love them like I love the 5 people I mentioned.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a part of me that always hated when someone said &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t have a lot of people you love in your life&rdquo;. Well fuck you. I&rsquo;ll damn well try. I&rsquo;d rather miserably fail in giving love than succeed in settling for just a small group.</p>
<p>I realized that every girl I was &ldquo;in a relationship&rdquo; with or that I was going to be with but something went wrong, I was ready to love. I didn&rsquo;t love them, but I was ready to love them.Â </p>
<p>I see people go into relationships to try to be in a relationship. I want to go into relationships because I want to love that person. I&rsquo;d rather fail in loving someone than fail to be with someone.</p>
<p>Failing to be with someone is easy. Failing to love someone hurts much more. Because if you&rsquo;re willing to love someone, then you expect that person is also willing to try to love you. We&rsquo;re scared of that, but, damn it, I want to be scared. And when it fails, I want to suck. I want to, when I see that girl, I want to hurt the first time, and I want it to hurt every next time, because that means that I was honest.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll get used to the pain, but I never want it to go away, because I want that failure to be there with me, because, I hope, when I meet someone and by the astronomical chances it works, I want to know that I never failed to be ready to love them.</p>
<p>With friends it works a little easier because we take it way less personal. But still, I want everyone else around me, whether we&rsquo;re out together a lot, or we see each other once a year or once every 5 years, or we just text sometimes, I want you who reads this, I want you to know that I&rsquo;m prepared to love you. I don&rsquo;t know if I will, but I&rsquo;m ready to try.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Damad Butkovic</p>
