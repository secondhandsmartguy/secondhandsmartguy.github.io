        <p>This is something that I have been thinking a lot lately.</p>
<p>How does history remember us?</p>
<p>Every generation has these huge events that they&rsquo;re remembered for and because of the simplifications that are common for a human mind, often we separate the participants of those events into &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo;. As history goes on, we seem to put more and more people into the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; category. A very small number of people have been remembered as universally good. Even the people that have achieved monumental things have a group of people today that consider them not only to be bad, but often as monsters. Whether it&rsquo;s slave ownership (most of the historical figures), misogynistic tendencies (for example Richard Feynman), homophobia (people who were held captive in concentration camps in second world war who were homosexual were locked back up after the allies liberated the camps) or anything else we find appalling in today&rsquo;s society, people have a tendency to hold that against you in the name of societal progress.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said this in the new year&rsquo;s letter, but it&rsquo;s not a bad thing to repeat. Today, we live in perhaps the most accepting time in history, where equality is more apparent than it ever was. However, we can, we should, and I hope we will do better, because it is far from perfect.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the title of this post.</p>
<p>If it means that more people will be accepted into society, less and less people will be judged and more people will get the same opportunities we do today, and, if by some miracle I am lucky enough to be remembered by history, I will volunteer to be considered a monster. If 300 years from now, society has made life more comfortable, pleasant and accepting for groups of people that may have defined themselves in the time when I was dead, but they couldn&rsquo;t emerge in my lifetime due to unconscious bigotry on my part and on our society&rsquo;s part, let along groups that are unaccepted today, I volunteer to be the monster.</p>
<p>No technological, medical or scientific advancement can be complete without the progress of society. And I&rsquo;m not blaming anyone. After all, the best we can do is do our best. I try to be the most accepting person and if I don&rsquo;t initially accept someone&rsquo;s stances on things, or their way of expressing themselves, regardless of how it defies my stances, I try to put in the time to see the world from their perspective and accept them.</p>
<p>So if the price that must be paid is that we all are remembered as monsters, I&rsquo;m glad to pay it, and I think we all should be, because there is no better way to have the world remember you, if that means that in their time, more people will be free to express themselves in any way, shape or form they want without harming others, and no better way to insure that more people are happy.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>Damad Butkovic</p>
